      <h1>Grandma's Moonshine</h1>
      <p>Stilled with love (and apple pie flavoring)!</p>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p1>Warm yourself from the inside with this apple cider flavored Moonshine. Moonshine is high-proof liquor that is produced illegally. The name was derived from a tradition of creating the alcohol during the nighttime, thereby avoiding detection. Warning: the stronger your moonshinee is the longer you have to keep the product stored to mellow the flavors. At the highest proof, three weeks is the estimated time to let it sit. The final product produces 14-20 servings. </p1>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>64 ounces apple cider (1/2 gallon, pure apple cider, not apple cider vinegar)</li>
        <li>64 ounces apple juice (1/2 gallon)</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon apple pie spice</li>
        <li>12 cinnamon sticks , divided</li>
        <li>3 cups 80 to 151 proof grain alcohol</li>
        <li>cup caramel vodka</li>
        <li>1 cup vanilla vodka</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
          <li>Add the apple cider, apple juice, both sugars, apple pie spice, and 6 cinnamon sticks to an extra large stock pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low and gently simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and cool COMPLETELY to room temperature. Discard the cinnamon sticks.</li>
          <li>Stir in the grain alcohol, caramel vodka, and vanilla vodka to the cooled mixture.</li>
           <li> 6 fresh cinnamon sticks among 6, 32 ounce mason jars.</li>
           <li>Pour moonshine into the jars. Seal jars tightly with lids.</li>
           <li>It is possible to drink right after it's finished, but it's strong. Ideally you should have the jars sit in a cool, dry, dark place for several weeks to mellow out before enjoying.</li>
        </ol>
