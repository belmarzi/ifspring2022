            <p>If you were raised in Louisiana like I was, Moonshine is not a foreign concept. Every family has their recipe for "white lightnin'" and has their own way of making the 150 proof alchohol tolerable. My grandmother recently let me in on the Favaloro trade secret, which turns what is normally undiblee into a dessert. This recipe is perfect for parties, as the recipe produces 20 servings, and tastes just like a perfect slice of apple pie.</p>
