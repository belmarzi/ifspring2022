      <h1>Grandma's Moonshine</h1>
      <p>(Apple Pie Edition)</p>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p1>Moonshine is high-proof liquor that is produced illegally. The name was derived from a tradition of creating the alcohol during the nighttime, thereby avoiding detection.</p1>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>64 ounces apple cider (1/2 gallon, pure apple cider, not apple cider vinegar)</li>
        <li>64 ounces apple juice (1/2 gallon)</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon apple pie spice</li>
        <li>12 cinnamon sticks , divided</li>
        <li>3 cups 80 to 151 proof grain alcohol</li>
        <li>cup caramel vodka</li>
        <li>1 cup vanilla vodka</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
          <li>Add the apple cider, apple juice, both sugars, apple pie spice, and 6 cinnamon sticks to an extra large stock pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low and gently simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and cool COMPLETELY to room temperature. Discard the cinnamon sticks.</li>
          <li>Stir in the grain alcohol, caramel vodka, and vanilla vodka to the cooled mixture.</li>
           <li> 6 fresh cinnamon sticks among 6, 32 ounce mason jars.</li>
           <li>Pour moonshine into the jars. Seal jars tightly with lids.</li>
           <li>It is possible to drink right after it's finished, but it's strong. Ideally you should have the jars sit in a cool, dry, dark place for several weeks to mellow out before enjoying.</li>
        </ol>
